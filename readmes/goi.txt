GOI Analysis
=============
GOI is the act of stressing the PAD with overshoot and undershoot to determine it's failures and hence, reliability, over a period of 100K hrs
OS/US is applied as 30/30 wherein, a surge equal to 30% of VDDS is applied for 30% of the Time-Period. 
These surges are applied both above VDDS and below VSS. 30/40, 40/30, 40/40, have similar meaning

DDR IOs
--------
Rx :-
Refer /proj/gateway4/products/gs70/expts/a0393831/SIMULATIONS/bcshtltcscdvpbfz/goa/goa_rx


Tx :-
In Tx mode, as the input is given at core-level and PAD is the output, OS/US hold no significance as the surges don't stress the IO Xtors.

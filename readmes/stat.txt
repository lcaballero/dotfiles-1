Statistical Analysis
=====================

Global Only :-
--------------
1.	Generate the global_snd_params file using the following command.
	SYNTAX : /proj/gateway/bin/getsndparamsf.pl <mmstat model file path> <global_snd_params output file name>
	
	NOTE : The generated global file with snd parameters has <pGlobal> parameter in it.
	       The global_snd_params file depends only on the mm_stat model file and not on the netlist


2.	Include the following in a deck 
	 - Include the global_snd_params file
	 - Include the mm_stat model file
	 - Set .OPTION rseed=<rseed>	: 'rseed' is the no. of runs, vary it as required (usually 1000)
	 - Set .PARAM pGlobal=1			: Enables global analysis
	 
	 
	 
Mismatch (Local) :-
-------------------
Continuing from above...

3.	Change the simulation option to ".OPTION LIST" (default is NOLIST) in the above deck
	Run spice -check <deck> at the worst case global point (by putting appropriate seed value) to generate the .prt file

	In case worst case global point cannot be identified or is not required, then any corner will do
	The .prt file is generated to obtain all the MOS parameters.

	Grep the SND parameters from the .prt file. This will contain the values of the SND params.
	Call this file global_snd_params_values
	
  
4.	Generate local mismatch params file using /proj/gateway/bin/getmmparamsf.pl
	SYNTAX : /proj/gateway/bin/getmmparamsf.pl <prt file> <mmstat model file path> <local_mm_param output file name>
	NOTE   : The local_mm_params file depends on the devices present in the netlist only and not on the model files
	
	This gets all devices from the prt file and creates local mismatch file with the following parameters:
	- pLocalAllDevices - This needs to be set to 1 at top level deck to enable local mismatch for all devices.
	- pLocal_<Device>  - Device specific local mismatch parameter; set to 1 by default in the generated mismatch file. 
 	User can turn on/off device specific analysis by setting the appropriate parameter, 
	present at the end of the generated mismatch file to 0.
	Note that this still needs pLocalAllDevices set to 1 at top level deck.


5.	Include the following in the deck 
	 - Replace 'global_snd_params' with 'global_snd_params_values' file
	 - Include the local_mm_params file
	 - Include mm_stat model file
	 - Set .PARAM pGlobal=0 		 : Disables global analysis
	 - Set .PARAM pLocalAllDevices=1 : This needs to be set to 1 at top level deck to enable local mismatch for all devices.
	 - Set .OPTION NOLIST			 : Change it back from LIST to avoid consuming lots of disk space during mismatch runs
	 - Set .OPTION rseed=<rseed>	 : 'rseed' is the no. of runs, vary it as required (usually 1000)
